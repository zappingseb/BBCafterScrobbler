""" Standard "encodings" Package

    Standard Python encoding modules are stored in this package
    directory.

    Codec modules must have names corresponding to normalized encoding
    names as defined in the normalize_encoding() function below, e.g.
    'utf-8' must be implemented by the module 'utf_8.py'.

    Each codec module must export the following interface:

    * getregentry() -> codecs.CodecInfo object
    The getregentry() API must a CodecInfo object with encoder, decoder,
    incrementalencoder, incrementaldecoder, streamwriter and streamreader
    atttributes which adhere to the Python Codec Interface Standard.

    In addition, a module may optionally also define the following
    APIs which are then used by the package's codec search function:

    * getaliases() -> sequence of encoding name strings to use as aliases

    Alias names returned by getaliases() must be normalized encoding
    names as defined by normalize_encoding().
